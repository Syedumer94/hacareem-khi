## Problem Statement 1: Book A Single Tap Ride

Build a progressive web app, Hybrid Mobile app, Android app or iOS app for a one time single click ride hailing utilizing our platform. Usually, customers have to register and verify by their cell phone numbers and email addresses to use our customer web site (app.careem.com), or Careem apps on iOS and Android. However, sometimes one time customers arriving at airports, hospitals, sporting or music events might not have the apps handy but could use a kiosk hosting a tablet or mobile device installed in these locations for one time rides. Users should only require to put in their cell phone numbers, optional drop off location, and be able to select the car type available for that city. They should be able to see the details of the assigned captain (Name, phone number) and vehicle (colour, make/model, registration number) along with the estimated time of arrival, estimated amount, and help line phone number before the app resets to welcome the next customer. Any cancelations or enquiries can be made via the provided phone numbers of the help line and captain. For extra points dispatch SMS for phone number PIN verification, captain assignment, trip updates.

**Things to Think About**
- Native or Hybrid
- What REST framework / JSON parser will you use
- User Experience
- In-memory vs. persistent storage
- Testing (unit testing/integration testing/functional testing/UI testing/mocking etc.)
- Design patterns, dependency injection etc.
- Crash recovery
- Recovery in case of automatic updates from platform stores


**Judging Criteria**
We will be judging you on the following criteria:
- Completeness
- Architecture
- Application Performance
- Code Toxicity
- Robustness

We can't wait to see what you create!

## Problem Statement 2: Careem Discounts

Promotions are discounts that brands offer to boost themselves for branding and sales, for example: Acme Brand offers 30% Discount on Summer Collection. “Careem discounts” is a feature within Careem iOS, Android, Web application, which shares promotional offers with Careem customers.

Promotions can be displayed at any stage, and time to our customers. It should be nice and smooth.
They can be categorized through various means, [Paid, Unpaid], [Food, Lifestyle, Travel, Education] and any other creative classifications.

You need to develop Android/iOS/Web application for Careem Discounts.

**Provided Prerequisites**
There are no provided Prerequisites for this statement. Participants needs to setup

**Things to Think About**
- Architecture and Frameworks to build application
- Storage Choices – Which Database and why
- Algorithm and Flow to work effectively
- Parameters to filter promotions
- Performance and Scalability of solution
- User Interface, Pleasant way to display promotions
- When and How promotions should be displayed?

**Judging Criteria**
- Creativity
- Completeness

- Robustness
- User Experience

We can't wait to see what you create!

## Problem Statement 3: Suggest a destination

Customers frequently travel the same routes. Given where the customer has asked to be picked up, suggest a destination for a Careem-tastic experience.

Your design / application will comprise of the following parts:

1. A suggestion engine that consumes rides as they happen. A publisher jar with sample data has been provided that you can run locally to simulate traffic to an endpoint that you create.
2. An API that suggests (one or more) destinations given a user ID, pickup location and pickup time - design for a speedy user experience (suggestions in less than 100ms).
3. A user interface (web or mobile) that integrates with this API.

Note that you can pick 1 and 2, or 2 and 3 based on your areas of interest. Going full-monty (1, 2 and 3) will earn you some extra nuggets!

**Things to think about:**
- Burst traffic (to the endpoint / API)
- Design patterns & dependency injection
- Testing (unit, integration, mocking etc.)
- Storage (in-memory vs. persistent, sql vs nosql etc.)

**Judging criteria:**
- Completeness
- Code Toxicity
- Architecture
- Scalability
- Performance
- Creativity

We can't wait to see what you create!
